\section{Introduction}
Stock markets from across the world are tracked using indices that measure a section of the stock market, such as the Nasdaq Composite Index. Price forecasting is a very important task in the financial industry, as it can be used to guide strategies of investors.

Historically, portfolio managers have used discretionary methods -- they rely on fundamentals and the judgement of analysts to make investment decisions \cite{harvey2017man}. However, with the rise of big data and computational power, systematic methods have become increasingly popular -- this focuses on rules-based strategies that are implemented by a computer and involve little to no human intervention \cite{harvey2017man}. 

In this project, we will investigate the following question: can we use regression models on stock market index data to forecast prices effectively?
